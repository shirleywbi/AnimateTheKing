# animate-king

Animation of a cartoon king who throws his crown and collapses

Tech Stack:

- Python Tkinter

How to Run: Run the king.py file

What I learnt:

- Math for rotations
- Basic Python

Improvements:

- Current implementation is one large script. Object-oriented programming would improve readability of code, splitting up the canvas drawings into individual classes.
